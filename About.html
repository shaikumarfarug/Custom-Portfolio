    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p class="about">
        Hello! My name is Rizwan, and Iâ€™m a passionate web developer with a background in Information Technology. 
        I have a B.Tech in IT and specialize in front-end and back-end development. I love building modern, responsive websites 
        and have worked on various projects, including a mental health prediction tool using machine learning algorithms. 
        I'm currently diving deeper into web development technologies like JavaScript, CSS frameworks, and backend development with Node.js.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
        Apart from coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring the latest in web design trends, and working on open-source projects.
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
    </p>
